# Datathon-Flight-Event-Analysis

Work from the Citadel East Coast Invitational Datathon, which took place on July 21, 2018. Teams were given data regarding airfare prices and airline information across different cities, events in different cities, weather, and stock data. They were subsequently asked to formulate their own questions about the data and answer those questions as rigorously as possible. 

Here, you can find my team's code, visualizations, and processed data that we submitted. We ended up winning 1st Place!
